The increasing sophistication of fraudulent activities within the insurance sector necessitates advanced detection mechanisms. Traditional fraud detection techniques, such as manual investigations and rule-based systems, have proven inadequate in addressing evolving fraudulent schemes. AI-driven solutions offer a promising alternative by leveraging machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and predictive analytics to detect fraudulent patterns more efficiently. This literature review explores existing research on AI's role in fraud detection, its applications, challenges, and future prospects. Some of the AI technologies in fraud detection are machine learning Machine Learning (ML), FRISS, SAS Fraud detection and Palantir Foundry.
AI-powered fraud detection systems offer numerous advantages, significantly improving accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness in identifying fraudulent claims. Unlike traditional methods, AI-driven systems reduce false positives and enhance detection rates by leveraging advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis, thereby minimizing human error and expediting claim assessments (Deloitte, 2023). Additionally, AI helps insurers cut costs by automating fraud investigations, reducing the need for extensive manual reviews, and preventing unnecessary payouts that result from fraudulent activities (PwC, 2022). Beyond financial benefits, AI fosters improved customer trust by ensuring fair and transparent claim evaluations. The use of Explainable AI (XAI) models enhances transparency, allowing policyholders to understand how decisions are made, ultimately reinforcing confidence in the integrity of insurance processes (Accenture, 2023).
AI technologies are transforming fraud detection in the insurance sector by enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. However, challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and implementation costs must be addressed to maximize AI's potential. Further research is needed to explore ethical considerations, long-term impacts, and strategies for SME adoption.
